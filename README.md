Multi-Threaded Store Inventory Management (Java)
Overview:
Developed a console-driven Java client-server application in the final year of my computer science program. Employed multithreading and integrated DerbyDB as the backend database to enhance the efficiency of a store inventory management system. The application enables store owners to capture, store, and manage detailed information about items, including price, quantity, and description.

Key Contributions:
Multi-Threaded Architecture:

Implemented a multi-threaded design for concurrent processing, optimizing performance and responsiveness in the client-server communication.
DerbyDB Integration:

Integrated DerbyDB to ensure secure and reliable storage of store inventory data.
Inventory Management:

Developed functionalities allowing store owners to capture and input information about each item, streamlining the management process.
Technologies Utilized:
Languages: Java
Concurrency: Multithreading
Database: DerbyDB
Client-Server Communication: Java Sockets
Achievements:
Successfully implemented a multi-threaded architecture for efficient and responsive client-server communication.
Demonstrated proficiency in integrating and utilizing DerbyDB for data storage.
Future Enhancements:
Real-Time Updates:

Envisioned real-time updates to ensure immediate reflection of changes in the store inventory.
Enhanced Security Measures:

Planned for the implementation of advanced security measures to protect sensitive store data.
Conclusion:
This project highlights my expertise in Java development, multithreading, and database integration. The emphasis on efficient inventory management aligns with real-world applications in the retail industry.
